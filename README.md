# Deno App Template

With tests and coverage. Some settings to make `deno lint` and `deno fmt` omit
coverage files. Generating a **completely optional** but nice HTML coverage
report requires you to have `lcov/genhtml` and `xdg-open` on your machine.

You can also see the only open pull request to see how coverage works. You can
change minimum coverage threshold and some other stuff in
`.github/workflows/inspect.yaml`.
